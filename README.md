ðŸ§  K-Means Customer Segmentation
This project applies K-Means clustering to the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset to identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: Mall Customer Segmentation Data

Features:

CustomerID

Gender

Age

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1â€“100)

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kmeans-customer-segmentation.git
cd kmeans-customer-segmentation
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook KMeans_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook to:

Load and preprocess the dataset

Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method

Apply K-Means clustering

Visualize the clusters

Evaluate clustering performance using the Silhouette Score

ðŸ“ˆ Results
Optimal Clusters: Identified optimal number of clusters (e.g., 5) using the Elbow Method.

Visualization: Visualized customer segments in 2D space using PCA.

Evaluation: Achieved a Silhouette Score of 0.55, indicating well-defined clusters.
